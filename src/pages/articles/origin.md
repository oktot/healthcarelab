text: 'There is something magical about the female form that is constantly inspiring to me. As an artist, I love to paint women because they are a source of power, myth, and creation. This piece was inspired in part by Courbet''s L''Origine du monde (1866), a standard of art history, that portrays a naked woman from the waist down. While the subject is very exposed, her identity, personality, and emotions remain concealed. I wanted to create my own origin piece-- but rather than create an image for the pleasure of the viewer, focus instead on someone enraptured in an examination of their own body. I hope that this piece inspires others to celebrate self discovery, to learn about our bodies, which carry the story of our world.'
